A simple landing page for a photography site built with pure HTML and CSS, featuring a functional sidebar created using only CSS, no JavaScript required.

The sidebar utilizes clever CSS techniques, including a hidden checkbox and off-screen positioning, to create an interactive user experience.

## Key Implementation Details

The sidebar functionality is achieved through the following CSS techniques:

1. The sidebar content is initially positioned off-screen to the left.
2. A hidden checkbox is placed beneath the hamburger icon.
3. When the checkbox is checked/unchecked (by clicking the hamburger icon to open and X icon to close), CSS rules adjust the sidebar's position to bring it into/out of view.
4. Transitions are applied to create a smooth sliding effect.
